# ML Engineer Practical Assessment – Task 1

## Dataset
PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset (Binary Classification)

## Objective
Build a production-grade ML pipeline including preprocessing, feature engineering,
model training, evaluation, and persistence.

## Steps Implemented
- Data cleaning and validation (handling invalid zero values)
- Feature engineering (4 meaningful features)
- Logistic Regression model with justification
- Stratified train-test split
- Cross-validation using F1-score
- Model evaluation with multiple metrics
- Model and scaler persistence
- Reproducibility using fixed random seeds
- Modular Python code (no single notebook)

## Model Choice
Logistic Regression was chosen for its interpretability, stability,
and suitability for binary classification problems.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Reproducibility
Random seeds were fixed to ensure consistent results across runs.

## Folder Structure
Code is modularized into separate Python scripts following production standards.
